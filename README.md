# CommanPrompt

This project contains a small web experiment that mimics a command line interface with colorful animations. The `index.html` file loads the page and ties together the JavaScript effects defined in `script.js`.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites:** A modern web browser is all that is required. No additional tools or servers are needed.
2. **Opening the Demo:**
   - Clone the repository.
   - Open `index.html` directly in your browser (`File -> Open` or double-click the file).
   - Start typing commands into the input field to see the animations.

## Usage Notes

- The command line area responds to each command you enter with random colors and emoji effects.
- Words such as `happy`, `fire`, or `star` trigger themed particles within the interface.
