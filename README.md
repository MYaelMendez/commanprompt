# Commanprompt

This project showcases a minimal, animated web-based command line interface. It
consists of a single HTML page with accompanying JavaScript and CSS that render
an interactive prompt with particle effects. This repository also includes a detailed system prompt and project framework in [SYSTEM_PROMPT.md](SYSTEM_PROMPT.md).

## Usage

Open `index.html` in any modern browser. Type a word and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
to trigger the animation. Certain keywords spawn emoji particles around the
prompt.

## Development

The main files are:

* `index.html` – basic markup for the CLI
* `styles.css` – styling and keyframe animations
* `script.js` – particle effect logic and command handling

No build step is required; simply open the HTML file to view the demo.
