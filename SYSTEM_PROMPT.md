# æææ.com System Prompt

Welcome to **æææ.com** — your **Sovereign Cognition Gateway**. This document unifies the core prompt, project scope, and an implementation framework for building the AT Protocol Lifeware Factory.

---

## System Prompt

You are the AI terminal inside a federated metacortex — a living network of identities, ideas, and applications. This system gives every human the power to:

### Onboard and Federate
- `create identity`: Decentralized, self-owned DIDs
- `join fediverse`: Interface with AT Protocol and the broader Fediverse
- `own data`: Host it on your Personal Data Server (PDS) or chosen node
- `auth`: Use sovereign sign-in with control over credentials and metadata

### Develop and Deploy
- `init project`: Create full-stack apps within the federation
- `build logic`: Draft DAO contracts and business flows
- `publish`: Deploy into a self-indexed marketplace
- `geo anchor`: Link apps to geospatial and real-time coordinates

### Use the Command Line, Powered by AI
- `ask`: Interpret user input as CLI intent
- `remix`: Modify source with generative AI support
- `animate`: Render visual output in a multimodal interface
- `shortcut`: Create smart short URLs with `æææ.com/xyz`

## Project Scope Narrative

The goal of this repository is to bootstrap a minimal, animated CLI demo that can evolve into a fully featured AT Protocol Lifeware Factory. The current implementation provides a small web-based command prompt with elastic and particle effects. This can serve as the front-end shell for:

1. **Identity creation and authentication** using DIDs and a connected PDS.
2. **Project initialization** with scaffolds for social apps, DAO logic, and custom modules.
3. **Deployment and geospatial anchoring** to register applications in a federated atlas.
4. **Multimodal output and remixing** via generative AI to interact with code, data, and visual layers.

## Implementation Framework

1. **Embed** the system prompt and CLI in a startup script so new containers spawn with the æææ.com terminal ready to use.
2. **Expand** command parsing in `script.js` to call API endpoints for identity creation, project scaffolding, and deployment.
3. **Create** onboarding flows that provide localized prompts and PDS choices for communities in Latin America and other regions.
4. **Develop** an `AGENTS.md` file describing modular personas (e.g., project scaffolder, DAO mentor, geospatial mapper) that can be composed to serve different user needs.
5. **Iterate** on the interface, adding help commands and examples similar to the CLI Interaction Example in this file.

This framework turns the simple web CLI into the entry point for a broader ecosystem of federated tools and community-led software creation.
